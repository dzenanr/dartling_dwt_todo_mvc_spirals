To Do

- test model

- edit todo
- validate todo text (task title) length
- validate todo unique text (task title)
  -- when there are 2 todos with the same text and you want to complete all,
     only one is completed; the other is not although its task is completed
     (find todo in Todos finds the first todo with that task.title)

- continue using Todo MVC css
