I tested everything on Windows 7 x 64.
I compared Java Script test results to GWT example from TodoMVC.com.

Dart
Windows/Dartium:
  OK

JavaScript
Windows/Chrome 28.0
  OK
Windows/Opera 15.0
  OK
Windows/Firefox 22.0
  no symbol for completed (checkbox only) - GWT example looks the same - ok
Windows/Safari 5.1.7
  no placeholder (input text stays after enter) - the same - problem
  footer display for Clear completed does not change - the same - problem
  no local storage - the same - problem
Windows/IE 10.0 - 10.0.9200.16635
  no symbol for completed (checkbox only) - GWT example looks the same - ok
  no placeholder (input text stays after enter)
  - input text empty as in GWT example - ok
  footer display does not change - all works fine - ok
  Clear completed does not function - all works fine - ok
  All Active Completed links do not function - all works fine - ok
  no local storage - all works fine - ok

Summarizing of that only Windows/Safari doesn't work
- behavior and L&F on other web browsers the same:

Windows/Safari 5.1.7
  no placeholder (input text stays after enter)
  footer display for Clear completed does not change
  no local storage﻿
