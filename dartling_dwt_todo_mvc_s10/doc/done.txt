I tested everything on Windows 7 x 64.
I compared Java Script test results to GWT example from TodoMVC.com.

  OK

JavaScript

  OK
Windows/Opera 15.0
  OK
Windows/Firefox 22.0
  no symbol for completed (checkbox only) - GWT example looks the same - ok
Windows/Safari 5.1.7
  no placeholder (input text stays after enter) - the same - problem
  footer display for Clear completed does not change - the same - problem
  no local storage - the same - problem
Windows/IE 10.0 - 10.0.9200.16635
  no symbol for completed (checkbox only) - GWT example looks the same - ok
  no placeholder (input text stays after enter)
  - input text empty as in GWT example - ok
  footer display does not change - all works fine - ok
  Clear completed does not function - all works fine - ok
  All Active Completed links do not function - all works fine - ok
  no local storage - all works fine - ok

Summarizing of that only Windows/Safari doesn't work
- behavior and L&F on other web browsers the same:

Windows/Safari 5.1.7

Environment and conditions
1. I checked our code in IE 9 under Windows 7 x 32.
2. I have compared our application and Todo GWT example and found
   that our code works better and much stable.
3. I installed Apache web server and pointed server Document Root option of
   httpd.conf to web folder of Spiral 10.
4. I added 'base.js' and 'ie.js' into the repository and updated '.gitignore'
   file

So what I found is that:
1. Java Script fails in two places when read/write window.localStorage because
   IE 9 and 10 don't support localStorage for local files.
   Not in any official documentation that I can find,
   but the same issue is described in this blog:
   http://www.wintellect.com/blogs/jprosise/using-html5-web-storage-for-interprocess-communication
2. HTML5 introduced the placeholder attribute on input elements,
   which allows to display a greyed-out default text.
   Sadly the Internet Explorer 9 does not support it.

Please set IE 10 as default web browser, select 'dartling_dwt_todo_mvc.html'
from web folder and "Run as JavaScript" from context menu.
You may open "F12 developer tools" of IE and check what's happens in console.ï»¿
