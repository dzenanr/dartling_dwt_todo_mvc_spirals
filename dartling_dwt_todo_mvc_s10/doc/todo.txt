To Do

Tried to exclude base.js from gitignore by using

!*/web/js/base.js

based on

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3203228/git-ignore-exception

However, the base.js file does not appear at GitHub.

In order to resolve the issue with base.js, 
in the last version of .gitignore *.js is removed:

.DS_Store
packages
pubspec.lock
*.js.deps
*.js.map
*~

There are only 2 differences with the standard application
http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/backbone/ :

1. links are not always underlined as they are in the standard application;
2. the x button has a background and a border in addition to x,
   while it is only x in the standard application.
