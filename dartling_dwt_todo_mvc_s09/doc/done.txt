Done

apply the original Todo MVC css as at http://todomvc.com/
demo: http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/backbone/
app spec: https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/wiki/App-Specification

+ move linkPanel from Header to TodoApp after footer
+ when there are no completed todos, clear completed button becomes invisible
+ cancel button renamed to Clear
+ left in selection is renamed to Active
+ title is todos; all other names start with capital letter
+ change font size of todos to 18 (original size is 24)
+ footer gets slightly different background color from page
+ todos are lables
  ++ when label is double-clicked text box is used to retitle todo
  ++ and check box and remove button are not displayed
+ use standard name for local storage (todos-dartling-dwt)
+ display authors
+ hovering over todo shows remove button
+ number of todos left is wrapped by <strong> tag

Problems

* base.css: .footer:before when put in a comment does not change anything!
* when in horizontal panel, displayed authors are not centered properly!
* if escape is pressed during new or edit todo, changes are not discarded
  (KEY_ESCAPE event does not happen)!
* when clear completed button becomes invisible, footer elements move!
* when not hovering over todos, border changes width!

Not done

- <input id="new-todo" placeholder="What needs to be done?" autofocus> !
  - how to add placeholder to newTodo (TextBox) in Header?
  - how to autofocus?
  - how to select text in TextBox by programming?
- replace selection ListBox by horizontal links!
- replace complete checkboxes by check symbol!
  -- I have tried it without success.

- add paper background (image?) to todos?
  -- complete all checkbox symbol should be moved to left corner of todos?
- renamed todo should stay in the same place?

- test on Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, IE9!
