Spiral 7

+ change the model in Model Concepts
  ++ title is now id
  ++ completed is now essential
+ generate the model's json in Model Concepts
+ copy json model to both model files (model.json in the root folder and
  model.dart) in the todo/mvc/json folder
+ gen code by using test/todo/mvc/todo_mvc_gen.dart
+ copy, from the console, then paste the TaskGen.withId constructor in
  both TaskGen and Task
+ run tests: 2 errors and 1 failure
  ERROR: Testing Todo.Mvc Update New Task Title with Failure
  Test failed: Caught *** Task.title is not updateable. ***
  ERROR: Testing Todo.Mvc Undo and Redo Update Task Title
  Test failed: Caught *** Task.title is not updateable. ***
  FAIL: Testing Todo.Mvc Find Task by Attribute then Examine Code and Id
  Expected: null
+ correct problems
+ test model with new tests

+ remove specific code from Task
  ++ remove compareTo (now id is used in sorting by default)
+ add specific code to Tasks
  ++ add find task by title id
  ++ add pre add validation (title cannot be longer than 64 characters)

+ validate todo text (task title) length
+ validate todo unique text (task title)
  ++ not possible any more:
     when there are 2 todos with the same title and you want to complete all,
     only one is completed; the other is not although its task is completed
     (find todo in Todos finds the first todo with that task.title)
