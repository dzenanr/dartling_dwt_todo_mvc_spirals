To Do

- apply the original Todo MVC css as at http://todomvc.com/
  -- <input id="new-todo" placeholder="What needs to be done?" autofocus>
     - how to add placeholder to newTodo (TextBox) in Header?
     - newTodo.focus = true; newTodo does not accept keyboard events!
  -- when I move linkPanel from Header to TodoApp after footer,
     it appears before footer!
  -- should cancel button be renamed to clear text or clear
     (confusion with clear (remove) completed)?
  -- replace complete checkboxes by the check symbol!
     I have tried it without success.
  -- the complete all checkbox symbol should be moved
     to the left corner of todos?
  -- check font sizes to be the same as in the original Todo MVC css!
  -- add the paper background (image?) to todos?
  -- replace selection ListBox by horizontal internal links?
  -- a renamed todo should stay in the same place!
  -- when there are no completed todos,
     make the clear completed button invisible?
